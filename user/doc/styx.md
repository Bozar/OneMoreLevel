# Styx

(Press Enter to view key bindings.)

As a ferryman, you need to sail across the Styx and bump the harbor (H) at the top right corner before the lantern goes out. Your lantern lasts 24 turns. Every action (move or wait) takes one turn. Restore 5 turns by bumping the lighthouse in the center.

The river flow changes its direction every three turns. You cannot enter a grid that has an opposing arrow. On the other hand, if you move in the same direction as a line of arrows, you can cover a long distance in a single turn.
