# Styx Ferryman

(Press Enter to view key bindings.)

Sail across Styx and reach the harbor (H) at the top right corner in 24 turns. Press arrow keys to move or Space to wait. When the lighthouse (L) at the center turns grey, your next movement costs 2 turns. Otherwise it takes 1 turn to move. Waiting 1 turn refreshes the map and resets the movement counter. [1]

You cannot enter a grid that has an opposing arrow. After entering an available grid, the water flow might carry you along to another place.

[1] The movement counter starts from zero and adds by one every time you move. It goes back to zero after reaching three. Waiting also resets it to zero. The counter goes more slowly when PC is on the right side of the dungeon.
