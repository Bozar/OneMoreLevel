## Winning and Losing

The dungeon is divided into two parts, the real world and the mirror world. To beat the game, you need to let an image in the mirror world collect five crystals (*). You will lose the game either due to running out of turns or you can no longer collect crystals.

## Mirrors

There is a long wall of mirrors (#) that splits the map. You will also encounter short walls of mirrors in the dungeon. A wall of mirrors blocks movement. It has two faces and creates a reflection under certain circumstances. More on this below.

## Moving Around

A phantom (p) in the real world moves towards PC (@) when he is nearby. A phantom's image (p, grey) in the mirror world never moves.

When PC moves in the real world, his image (@, grey) in the mirror world also moves symmetrically. If either PC or his image is blocked by a mirror, a phantom or a phantom's image, neither of them can move. See Bumping a Target, below.

You can press Space to wait 1 turn.

## Bumping a Target

When a phantom in the real world bumps adjacent PC, the real world swaps with the mirror world.

When PC bumps a phantom in the real world, four things happen. Firstly, the countdown timer restores 5 turns. Secondly, the phantom disappers. Thirdly, the phantom's image appears in the mirror world. And lastly, one or more phantoms might appear in the real world as mirror reflections.

There can be at most 5 phantom images in the mirror world. Random extra images are removed whenever a new image is created.

When PC's image bumps a phantom's image in the mirror world, the phantom's image disappears. The current turn ends after this bumping and neither PC nor his image can move this turn.

When both PC and his image bumps a phantom and another phantom's image, you can pretend that three things happen in turn, even though the game does not work like this behind the scene. Phantom A disappears. Phantom B's image disappears. Phantom A's image appears.

## Collecting a Crystal

In the real world, a crystal dose not block movement. When PC or a phantom stands on a crystal, their symbol turns into a rectangle.

Any image in the mirror world can collect a crystal by standing on it. There are three ways to collect a crystal. The most direct way is let PC's image move over a crystal. You can also let PC or a phantom stands on a crystal, and swap two worlds in the next turn. A new crystal appears in a random position after the previous one is collected.

If in the real world, there are only PC and a crystal but no phantoms, you can never collect any more crystals. This results in an instant death.
