# Desert

You need to bump and collect 5 quality spices (*) from a living sandworm to beat the game. But you cannot press Space to wait in desert, which makes the collecting job a little bit harder.

A sandworm has a head (diamond), a tail (-) and body segments (+). The third, fourth and fifth segment contains spice (?) or quality spice (*). You can only interact with segments that have spices. Other sandworm parts (head, body and tail) act like indestructible walls.

Every turn a sandworm moves one grid in a random direction. Eventually it will tunnel into ground and leave a wall of dune behind. An immobilized sandworm or one with fewer than three spices are more eager to go underground.

A dunes is composed of sand walls (#) and spices (?). You can bump and destroy a wall block or collect a spice just as from a sandworm. You do not move when bumping. It can be used as poor man's waiting key.

You might lose the game due to one of three reasons.

You can survive in desert for at most 24 turns. Every spice and quality spice extends your remaining time by 4 turns.

PC's symbol changes into a rectangular when being adjacent to a sandworm's head. The game ends if the sandworm intends to move into PC's position the next turn.

When your turn starts, if you are surrounded by four solid blocks, either press Space or bump into a sandworm segment to end the game.
