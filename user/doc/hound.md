It was a dark and stormy night. I did not speak with my friend since afternoon because he criticized my previous work, A Study in Emerald, as a thriller by an untalented writer. As for now, he was quietly investigating a curious wooden figurine from Mycroft. "I don't think a man with an octopus head shaves his tentacles, my dear doctor." He put the figurine down and gave me an opened envelop. "On the other hand, can you read this letter for me? It's from the Baskervilles."
