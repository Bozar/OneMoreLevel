# Only My Railgun Can Shoot It

[INPUT_HINT]

> Doomguy believes that danger is the abbreviation of deadly anger. Doomguy enters Baator with a railgun and mere five charges. Doomguy engraves the railgun barrel with MM. "It means Might and Mercy." so says Doomguy.

You need to accumulate 6 and 6 and 6 devil kills before you are allowed to leave Baator. However, your armor corrodes in 24 turns. You lose the game if running out of turns or being hit by a devil's scorching ray. There is also a third checkmate pattern. When you have no ammo and are surrounded by buildings or devils in four directions, the game ends automatically.

## Explore, Shoot & Loot

Press Space to switch between move mode and aim mode. This action costs no turns.

In move mode, you are an "at" symbol (@). Press arrow keys to move around. You cannot enter a grid that is occupied by a wall (#) or a devil (d). Moving 1 step costs 1 turn. When you move over and pick up a survial kit (?), you restore 4 turns and 1 charge of ammo. You have at most 24 turns and 5 charges.

You cannot move to or away from a devil in a straight line if: (1) The devil is in your sight and is about to attack (more details below). (2) There are no other devils in between you two. (3) You can move aside or shoot back.

In aim mode, your symbol is a number that shows your remaining ammo. Press arrow keys to shoot in a direction. Beware that the game does not prevent you from attacking a wall. You cannot shoot without ammo. You do not move when shooting. The action itself costs 1 turn and 1 charge.

A railgun projectile flies in a straight line until it reaches an edge of the map, hits a wall, or hits and kills a devil. A dead devil leaves a survival kit where it stands. The kit can either be picked up by PC or be destroyed by a passing devil.

PC has a T shaped field of view. You see 6 grids away in your facing direction, 4 grids on both sides, and 1 grid behind. The facing direction changes when moving or shooting. Your line of sight is blocked by a wall. The sight system handles a devil, a survival kit and a wall differently.

* A devil is visible only when in sight.
* A survival kit is always visible.
* A wall is visible when in sight. An out-of-sight wall is dark grey if PC has seen it before, otherwise it is invisible.

There are three counters at the bottom right corner of the screen. They act as walls and are always visible and dark grey. They show your remaining kills.

## Do Devious Devils Dream of Catsplosion?

A devil's default symbol is a lower case d. If it is in an unblocked straight line with PC and no more than 4 steps away, its symbol turns into an upper case D, which means it will cast a burning ray the next turn. The ray travels like a railgun projectile until it hits something. If a devil is killed by friendly fire, it drops a survival kit, may trigger devil respawn (see below), but does NOT count as your kill. If you are hit instead, your killer glows like the letter with a wicked sharp angle -- "On A field, sable, the letter A, gules".

A devil hears you 8 steps away. If you keep firing for two or more consecutive turns, all devils' ear shots extend to 12 grids starting from the second turn. The ear shot resets to 8 once you move. If a devil cannot see you, it approaches a survival kit within 8 steps instead.

The dungeon holds at most 6 devils. When 2 or more of them dies, new ones respawn. A new devil is at least 6 grids away from you.

## Calculate Kill Counts

Achieving 18 kills is different from killing 18 devils. A victim of your railgun counts as one kill. Besides, you receive one more kill if the target is adjacent to you. Another one is granted if you have no ammo left after killing. Therefore you are rewarded with 3 kills by shooting a devil one step away from you with your last charge of ammo. This is a win-win situation. Doomguy gains kills more quickly and devils suffer fewer casualties. Making such a tacit agreement is commonly described as D4C (Do a Decent Deal with a Devil Constantinely).

## Side Quest: Curious Symbols

> Someone draws a group of curious symbols on a wall. Rumors say that this is a user guide written in Dabus language, which opens a portal to Pillar of Skulls. Record these symbols if possible, so that Doomguy will be able to share them with his friends on the island.

Finding curious symbols is a side quest that has no impact on your main quest. Complete it for fun or for extra challenge. A special wall marked as an upper case X is at least 10 steps away from your starting position. Try to move adjacent to it. After that, its symbol changes into an upper case P.
