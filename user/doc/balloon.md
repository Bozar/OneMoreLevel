# Balloon Travellers

(Press Enter to view key bindings.)

> Sit in a hot balloon and fly across a power station. Reach designated places to collect spare parts. Do not bump into tower like chimneys when possible.

During the balloon trip, you need to end your turn at five destinations marked with question marks (?). You have at most 24 turns. You lose the game when running out of turns. Reaching a destination restores 4 turns for once.

You can move over the border of the dungeon and reappear on the opposite side. When there is a chimney (#) in the way, the balloon will try to step back one grid if possible. Bumping into a chimney for the first time restores 1 turn. Then the chimney symbol turns into double exclamation marks (!!). Bumping into it again does not restore turns.

Every turn the balloon moves two steps. Firstly, it goes with the wind. The wind direction is indicated by an arrow and it changes every 3 turns. [1] Secondly, the balloon responds to your key input, which could be one of four directions (arrow keys) or waiting (Space).

Indicators on the top left corner show the direction and duration of the current wind wave, and the direction of the next wave.

[1] The wind direction is more likely to change into its vertical counterparts: from left/right to up/down, or vice versa. And it is less likely to remain unchanged for another three turns. It never changes to the opposite direction: between left and right, or up and down.
