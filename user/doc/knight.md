# Silent Knight Hall

(Press Enter to view key bindings.)

Kill the boss with three symbols (S, P and D) to beat the game. However, the boss will not show up until you have killed three captains (C). Whether or not to kill knights (K) is your own choice.

You lose the game either because of running out of time or being killed by an enemy. You have at most 24 turns. Every action (move, roll over, attack and wait) costs exactly 1 turn. Whenever an enemy dies, your remaining time extends by 4 turns.

An enemy has three status. In the normal status, his symbol is an upper-case alphabet. He either waits one turn or approaches PC. Such an enemy acts like a wall. PC cannot bump attack or pass through him.

If he starts his turn being adjacent to PC, the enemy becomes alert (!) and waits one turn. An upside-down exclamation mark means an alert elite (captains or the boss). Such an enemy will attack grids marked by double excmamation marks (danger zone) the next turn. PC's symbol turns into a solid rectangle if he is inside the zone. This attack kills PC and distracted knights (K, see below). By bumping into an alert enemy, PC rolls over to the other side of the enemy if the destination is not occupied.

    @ ! .   <-- Roll over.
    @ ! #   <-- Cannot roll over, blocked by wall.
    @ ! K   <-- Cannot roll over, blocked by knight.

An enemy becomes distracted (?) and waits one turn after attacking. Similarly, an upside-down question mark means an elite. Bump attack a distracted enemy to kill him. Knights (K) and captains (C) can be killed by 1 hit. The boss requires 3 hits to kill. He has three symbols to indicate his hit points (S: 0 HP, P: 1 HP, D: 2 HP).
