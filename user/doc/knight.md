# Silent Knight Hall

Kill the boss who has 3 HP and 3 symbols (S, P & D) to beat the game. The boss will not show up until you have killed enough captains (C).

A knight becomes alert (!) if he starts his turn being adjacent to you. He will attack every grid in danger zone (!) the next turn.

Bump and roll to the opposite side of an alert enemy. A knight is vulnerable only when distracted (?).
