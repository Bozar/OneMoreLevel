# One More Level

## About This Game

One More Level is a turn-based Roguelike game made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org). The GUI font, [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), is created by Nikita Prokopov. The tileset, [curses_vector](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161328.0), is created by DragonDePlatino for Dwarf Fortress.

Every time you start the game, One More Level presents you with a theme dungeon of unique mechanics and goals. This idea comes from [HyperRogue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/342610/HyperRogue/), one of the most bizarre and fascinating games I have ever played. You can beat the game in five minutes, so it never hurts to go down just one level deeper.

## Keybindings

Godot engine natively supports keyboards and gamepads (Xbox, DualShock and Nintendo). Xbox buttons are shown in square brackets below.

* Move: Arrow keys, Vi keys, ASDW, [Direction pad].
* Wait: Space, Z, Period (.), [A].
* Help: Esc, Slash (/), [B].
* Reload: Space, [A].
* Quit: Ctrl + W, [Select].

## Core Mechanics

As mentioned above, every theme dungeon has a unique winning condition. Press the `Help` key to read it. The help text is also available in `doc/guide/`. Articles in `doc/manual/` explain game mechanics in more detail, though they might spoil the fun of discovery.

You lose the game if running out time. Remaining turns are shown on the upper right corner. However, there is always a way to gain more turns. You may also get killed by other causes in a dungeon.
